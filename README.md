# Fraudlent-Transaction-Data-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to proactively detect fraudulent transactions using a dataset containing 6.3 million rows. The analysis includes data cleaning, model development, variable selection, performance demonstration, and infrastructure improvement recommendations.

## Key Objectives
1. Data Cleaning: Address missing values, outliers, and multi-collinearity to ensure data integrity and quality.
2. Fraud Detection Model: Develop and describe a robust fraud detection model leveraging machine learning techniques.
3. Variable Selection: Identify and select the most significant variables contributing to fraud detection.
4. Model Performance: Utilize the best set of tools to demonstrate the model's performance and validate its accuracy.
5. Predictive Factors: Determine key factors that predict fraudulent activities and evaluate their significance.
6. Actionable Insights: Provide recommendations for infrastructure updates to prevent fraud based on the analysis.
7. Implementation and Evaluation: Suggest measures to implement the recommended actions and methods to assess their effectiveness.

## Task Completed
1. Data cleaning including missing values, outliers and multi-collinearity.
2. Describe your fraud detection model in elaboration.
3. How did you select variables to be included in the model?
4. Demonstrate the performance of the model by using best set of tools.
5. What are the key factors that predict fraudulent customer?
6. Do these factors make sense? If yes, How? If not, How not?
7. What kind of prevention should be adopted while company update its infrastructure?
8. Assuming these actions have been implemented, how would you determine if they work?
