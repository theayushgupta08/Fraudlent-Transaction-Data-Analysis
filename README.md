# Fraudlent-Transaction-Data-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to proactively detect fraudulent transactions using a dataset containing 6.3 million rows. The analysis includes data cleaning, model development, variable selection, performance demonstration, and infrastructure improvement recommendations.

## Key Objectives
1. Data Cleaning: Address missing values, outliers, and multi-collinearity to ensure data integrity and quality.
2. Fraud Detection Model: Develop and describe a robust fraud detection model leveraging machine learning techniques.
3. Variable Selection: Identify and select the most significant variables contributing to fraud detection.
4. Model Performance: Utilize the best set of tools to demonstrate the model's performance and validate its accuracy.
5. Predictive Factors: Determine key factors that predict fraudulent activities and evaluate their significance.
6. Actionable Insights: Provide recommendations for infrastructure updates to prevent fraud based on the analysis.
7. Implementation and Evaluation: Suggest measures to implement the recommended actions and methods to assess their effectiveness.
